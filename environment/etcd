# etcd config

# The following values are used to configure the secured etcd cluster
#

# The name of the node in the cluster
NODE_NAME="--name etcd3"

# List of this member's peer URLs to advertise to the rest of the cluster
ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS="--initial-advertise-peer-urls https://192.168.1.101:2380"

# This flag tells the etcd to accept incoming requests from its peers on the specified scheme://IP:port combinations.
# If 0.0.0.0 is specified as the IP, etcd listens to the given port on all interfaces. 
# If an IP address is given as well as a port, etcd will listen on the given port and interface. 
# Multiple URLs may be used to specify a number of addresses and ports to listen on. 
# The etcd will respond to requests from any of the listed addresses and ports.
